# Node / Create-React-App mashup

Read the instructions thoroughly before starting your project.

## Setup

- `git clone` this repo
- `cd` into it.
- `yarn install`
- `cd client && yarn install`

## Available build commands

- `yarn dev`: Runs BOTH your Express.JS and React developer environment locally at the same time. Any logs coming from Express will be prefaced with `[0]`, any logs from `create-react-app` will be prefaced with `[1]`.
- `yarn server`: Runs JUST your Express.JS server.
- `yarn client`: Runs JUST your front-end React app.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your local React app in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

## To deploy

NOTE: Heroku specifically runs `npm start`, so don't remove that from your package.json file.

- `heroku create your-app-name`
- `git push heroku master`

## Project Requirements

- [ ] Your project should pull data from an API. There are lots of options [here](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) and [here](https://market.mashape.com/).
  - Avoid any APIs that require OAuth (we'll talk about that later).
  - Many APIs require an API key. Just sign up for an account and attach the key to your URL. Please make sure not to share your secret keys in a public GitHub repo.
  - Some APIs don't allow _Cross-Origin Resource Sharing_ (CORS), meaning you can't make AJAX requests to them. You can get around this by proxying your requests with your Express server.
- [ ] Your project should render a list of data from the API.
  - [ ] Your project should allow the list to be filtered or searched.
- [ ] Your project should show details about a single resource when clicked.
- [ ] Your project should look (really) pretty!
- [ ] You and your team should employ good Git and GitHub collaboration practices.
- [ ] Your project must have a README.md file explaining what the project does and why it matters. [Here's an example](https://github.com/codeforamerica/howto/blob/master/Good-READMEs.md) of a great README.md template.

## Bonus

- Fanciful animations and transitions
- Incorporate multiple APIs into a single app

## Demo Requirements

Create a slide deck for the technical panel. (Here's an [example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15rfR-S5qAlzx4rHwBp_kJOlu0nQ7hcZOruTwbH6zRvQ/edit?usp=sharing).)

- It should focus on _how_ you built the app.
- Include code snippets with brief explanations. Or, specific references to the location of the code in your GitHub repo.
- It should emphasize your technical setbacks and solutions.
- Get straight to the point.
- Be prepared to answer questions.
